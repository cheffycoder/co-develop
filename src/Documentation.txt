 Deployed using Heroku



 Frontend Overview: 
 There will be 2 pages.
 First is the Home Page and Second is the Editor Page.

 As soon as user makes a new room or enter an existing room details he will be routed to Editor page. // React Router used.
 For Code Editor we are using the open source Code Editor Code Mirror and will do some modifications.



 // Steps for Deployment

 At first we ran the production build command and made a static build for the application.
 The idea is that as soon as someone hits the deployed url, he/she should be served with the index.html file from the build folder.

 Hence, we have to configure the backend to work like this.

 We also have to make changes in package.json

 -> Changing the start script, because in production by default npm start is ran.
 -> Thus, changing the start command to first build the application and then running the server:prod command.

 As soon as backend server starts it knows from where to serve the index.html file.
